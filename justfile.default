# The `./?dir=dev` part is important. It executes nix command from  the parent folder, pointing to a sub-folder instead of entering the subfolder.
# If you enter a folder of a submodule and execute nix command from there, it will copy the submodule to its own /nix/store folder, without parent.

check-fmt:
    nix flake check "./?dir=dev&submodules=1"

# No need to use `./?dir=dev` here, because `fmt` isn't a part of flake command, yet it uses output.<system>.formatter package. 
# ðŸ˜• Very intuitive

fmt:
    cd ./dev; nix fmt ../

generate-pre-commit:
    nix develop "./?dir=dev&submodules=1#pre-commit"
